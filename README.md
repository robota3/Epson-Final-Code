Overview
This project demonstrates the capabilities of an Epson robot in automating pick-and-place, stacking, and item-counting tasks. The code is structured to provide seamless execution of all three tasks.

Task Details
Task 1: Pick and Place

The robot picks an object from a specified location and places it at a target location.
Task 2: Stacking

The robot stacks objects in a predetermined order or pattern.
Task 3: Counting and Writing

The robot integrates with a counting mechanism and records the count.
Features
Efficient and accurate pick-and-place operations.
Robust stacking with error handling for alignment issues.
Real-time integration for counting and data logging.
Installation
Prerequisites
Epson RC+ Software (for robot programming and control).
A computer with the robot driver installed and connected.
Necessary hardware setup for the Epson robot.
Steps
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/robota3/Epson-Final-Code.git
cd Epson-Final-Code
Open the project in Epson RC+ software:

Import the files into a new or existing project.
Ensure the hardware connections are set up and configured according to the robot's manual.

Compile and load the code onto the Epson robot.

Usage
Running Tasks
Task 1: Pick and Place
Execute the pick-and-place code using:
bash
Copy code
[Command/Procedure to execute Task 1]
Task 2: Stacking
Run the stacking operation by loading the stacking program in Epson RC+.
Task 3: Counting and Writing
Start the counting and writing program. Ensure the counting sensor/system is connected.
Notes
For optimal performance, ensure the workspace is clear and all objects are within the robot's range.
Follow safety guidelines as per the Epson robot's manual.
